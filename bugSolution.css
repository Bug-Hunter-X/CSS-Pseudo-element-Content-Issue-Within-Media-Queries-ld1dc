The solution is to ensure that the `content` property of the pseudo-element is correctly specified within the media query.  Make sure that the content you want to display is specified as a string, or using other correct content values.

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element::before {
    content: "This text is shown!"; /* Correct content property */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
  }
}
```
By correctly defining the `content` property within the media query, the pseudo-element will display as intended when the media query's condition is met.
