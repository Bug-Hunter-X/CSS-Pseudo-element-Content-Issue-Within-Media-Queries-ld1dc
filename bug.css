The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element selector (:before or :after) is used within a media query, but the target element's content property is not defined or is incorrectly specified within the media query itself. This leads to the pseudo-element not appearing as expected.

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element::before {
    content: "This text is not shown"; /* Content property missing or incorrect */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
  }
}
```

This results in the pseudo-element content not being displayed in the specified media query.
